Intranet Revaluation Form Submission System
The IRSS aims to replace the conventional system of applying for revaluation by submitting hard
copy of the receipts with an online system for submitting the subjects required.This system
operates using the intranet server provided by the college. The system is accessible through
mobile and web browsers.The system relies on a 3rd
party payment platform like PayTM which works independent of this system. It generates the list
consisting the details necessary for the operators at the Exam Cell to fill the required fields for
each student in the university portal.
